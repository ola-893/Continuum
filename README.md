## The Problem: The "Rich Asset, Poor Liquidity" Paradox

In the current Real World Asset (RWA) market, asset ownership is static while financial needs are dynamic.

- **The Liquidity Trap**: An asset owner (e.g., a landlord) might own a property worth $1M generating $5,000/month, but they cannot access that future income today to pay for immediate expenses (like a roof repair) without taking out a high-interest bank loan with weeks of paperwork.
- **The "Decoupling" Risk**: When a tokenized asset is sold on a secondary market (like an NFT marketplace), the income stream often fails to move with it automatically. This creates a chaotic scenario where the old owner keeps receiving rent that belongs to the new owner, requiring manual reconciliation.
- **Compliance Friction**: RWA protocols struggle to enforce real-time regulatory checks (KYC/AML) at the exact moment of income withdrawal, exposing issuers to regulatory fines if funds stream to a sanctioned wallet.

## The Solution: Continuum - The Solvency-Aware RWA Protocol

Continuum is a compliant, object-oriented streaming protocol on Aptos that turns static assets into liquid, programmable cash flow.

### 1. Instant Liquidity via "Flash Advance" (The Innovation)

**How it works**: We utilise the deterministic nature of money streaming to allow asset owners to "borrow" from their own future.

**The Fix**: Instead of waiting 30 days for rent, a landlord can trigger a Flash Advance to withdraw 3 months of future income instantly. The smart contract mathematically guarantees solvency by "pausing" their future withdrawals until time catches up to the debt. No banks, no interest, just time-travelling liquidity.

### 2. True Asset-Yield Coupling (The Architecture)

**How it works**: By leveraging Aptos Objects, we bind the income stream directly to the NFT, not a user address.

**The Fix**: If Alice sells her Real Estate NFT to Bob on a marketplace, the stream instantly redirects the very next second of yield to Bob. There is no manual transfer required; the yield follows the asset, ensuring 100% fair distribution during secondary sales.

### 3. The "Compliance Guard" Layer (The Safety)

**How it works**: A modular governance wrapper that intercepts every withdrawal request.

**The Fix**: Before a single USDC leaves the contract, the system verifies the recipient’s on-chain Identity (DID). If a user's KYC has expired or they are sanctioned, the stream automatically freezes, protecting the issuer from regulatory liability.

Continuum is a next-generation RWA (Real World Asset) protocol built on Aptos that enables tokenisation of real-world assets with continuous yield distribution through on-chain streaming.

## 📖 Key Concepts

### Yield Streaming

Instead of monthly/quarterly distributions, yields flow continuously:

```
Claimable = (flow_rate * seconds_elapsed) - amount_withdrawn
```

Users can claim anytime, seeing their balance tick up in real-time.

### Flash Advance

Borrow against future yields:
- Request advance amount
- Stream pauses for calculated duration
- Resume after pause expires

### Compliance Layer

All interactions check KYC status:
- Users must be whitelisted
- Jurisdiction restrictions enforced  
- Admin can freeze assets instantly

---

## 🔐 Security

- **Emergency Freeze** - Admins can halt specific assets
- **Compliance Checks** - Every transfer validates KYC status
- **Ownership Verification** - NFT ownership checked on-chain
- **Time-Lock Mechanisms** - Flash advances pause streams
